# kNN-with-5-Fold
Simple  KNN application make to learn about diabetic data yang implemented  scaling, k-fold-cross-validation

I Make this program to fullfil Introducton to Artificial Intelegence task, and this build without any library related to KNN like sklearn, scikit ,etc
so this program will running not efficient and around 9 minutes to get the optimum K and the Average Accuracy  in my laptop (HP ENVY 13 2019), and you need to have
csv, statistic, and math library to running this.

In this program have 3 different distance calculation you can choose one of them, and 2 scaling methods you can choose one, dan you can set how many 
iteration you need default i set it on 0-41 (40 Loops) and the dataset used is from Pima India Diabetes Dataset (PIDD)
